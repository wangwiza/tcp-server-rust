\section{TCP Server}

% - An outline and brief explanation of your TCP server - include all assumptions, as well as any non-trivial implementation details related to processing requests from multiple clients.

\section{Concurrency Paradigm}

% 1: No Concurrency 	The server handles one client at a time and one request from the clients at a time
% 2: Client-Level Concurrency 	Multiple clients, each with its own TCP stream, can run concurrently, but I/O and CPU tasks in the same CPU are not executed concurrently
% 3: Task-Level Concurrency 	Multiple clients can run concurrently + I/O and CPU tasks in the same CPU are executed concurrently.

% - Explain the concurrency paradigm used in your concurrent implementation and how the clients' requests are being handled concurrently.

\section{Concurrency Level}

% - What level of concurrency does your server achieve and why? Explain your design. Briefly explain ALL cases when the concurrency level decreases from your claimed level of concurrency.

\section{Server Parallel Tasks}

% - Will your server run tasks in parallel? Briefly explain.

% - If you have tried multiple implementations, explain the differences and your evolution to the current submission. There is no need to submit your alternative implementations.
