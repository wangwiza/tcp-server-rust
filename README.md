This project is a high-performance, asynchronous TCP server built in Rust. It's designed to efficiently handle multiple concurrent clients and process different types of computational tasks by leveraging a hybrid concurrency model with **Tokio** for asynchronous I/O and **Rayon** for parallel CPU-bound computations.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Hybrid Concurrency Model**: Utilizes a Tokio multi-threaded runtime for non-blocking network I/O and a separate Rayon thread pool for CPU-intensive work, ensuring that heavy computations don't block the async event loop.
* **Task-Level Concurrency**: Achieves true parallelism by intelligently delegating I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks to their respective thread pools, allowing them to execute simultaneously across multiple clients.
* **Asynchronous & Non-Blocking**: Built on Tokio, the server can manage thousands of concurrent TCP connections efficiently, spawning a lightweight asynchronous task for each incoming connection.
* **Scalable Task Processing**: Designed to handle distinct workloads, including CPU-intensive calculations and simulated I/O delays, by offloading CPU tasks to the Rayon pool.

## üî¨ Architecture Overview

The server's core design revolves around two distinct thread pools to optimize for different kinds of work.

1.  **Tokio Runtime (Async I/O)**: A Tokio runtime with 6 worker threads is created to handle all network-related operations. When a client connects, the main listener task accepts the connection and spawns a new async task to handle all communication with that specific client. This allows the server to remain responsive to new connections while processing data for existing ones.

2.  **Rayon Thread Pool (Parallel CPU)**: A global Rayon thread pool with 10 threads is initialized and shared across all connection-handling tasks using an `Arc`. When a request for a CPU-intensive task is received, the work is dispatched to the Rayon pool. This prevents the CPU-bound work from blocking the Tokio worker threads, which can continue managing I/O for other clients.

Communication between the Tokio tasks and the Rayon threads is bridged using a `tokio::sync::oneshot` channel. The Tokio task awaits the result from the channel, which is sent by the Rayon thread upon completing its computation.

The `bonus` implementation further demonstrates this model by introducing a `MysteryTask`, which is dynamically routed to either the CPU or I/O handler based on a random probability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need the Rust toolchain installed. If you don't have it, you can install it with `rustup`.
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf [https://sh.rustup.rs](https://sh.rustup.rs) | sh
```

### Running the Server

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/wangwiza/tcp-server-rust.git](https://github.com/wangwiza/tcp-server-rust.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd tcp-server-rust
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    The application starts both the server and a benchmarking client. It requires four command-line arguments: port, seed, total clients, and messages per client.

    ```bash
    cargo run --release <PORT> <SEED> <NUM_CLIENTS> <MESSAGES_PER_CLIENT>
    ```

    **Example:**
    This will start the server on port `8080` and simulate `50` clients, each sending `50` messages, using an initial random seed of `12345`.

    ```bash
    cargo run --release 8080 12345 50 50
    ```

## üîå Code Overview

The project logic is organized into several key files:

  * `src/main.rs`: The entry point for the application. It parses command-line arguments and spawns two main threads: one for the `Server` and one for the benchmarking `Client`.
  * `src/server.rs`: Contains the core server logic.
      * `start_server`: Initializes the Tokio and Rayon runtimes. It binds a `TcpListener` and enters an infinite loop to accept new connections.
      * `handle_connection`: Each new connection is handled here. It reads incoming requests line-by-line from the `TcpStream`.
      * `get_task_value`: Parses the task type and seed from a request. It then delegates the task to the appropriate handler:
          * `CpuIntensiveTask`: Spawns the task on the `rayon_pool` and awaits the result via a oneshot channel.
          * `IOIntensiveTask`: Handles the task asynchronously within Tokio using `tokio::time::sleep`.
  * `src/client.rs`: A benchmarking client that connects to the server. It spawns a specified number of threads, where each thread represents a client sending a sequence of messages to the server.
  * `src/task.rs`: Defines the `TaskType` enum (`CpuIntensiveTask`, `IOIntensiveTask`) and implements the functions that perform the actual work, such as a heavy computational loop or an asynchronous delay.
